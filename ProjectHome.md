**Integrated Search for Android Market** is a browser extension that lets you get Android Market results directly in your Google search results.

In addition to helping you find the mobile app information you’re looking for, Google Search now also makes it easier for you to get the actual apps themselves while you’re searching.

While Google Search, you’ll get special links and content at the top of the search results. You can click these links to go directly to the application’s Android Market page. You can also get a quick look at some of the application’s basic details including the icon, title, category, and developer. These results will appear when your search pertains to a mobile application. For example, try searching for weather on your Android-powered device.
